# Boyfriend-Alert
I made this project as a birthday present for my girlfriend as a way of getting my attention quickly and easily when I was intensly focused on my computer.

The TLDR is that I made this as a birthday present to my girlfriend so she could get my attention while I'm super focused on video games or programming. I put the URL to my home server as an apple browser home shortcut so she could just tap the icon and activate the light.
